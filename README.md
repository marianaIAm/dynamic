<h1>Dynamic Build</h1>

<h2>The Pain Point</h2>
<p>Clients love working out with their trainer. Although clients need to be active on a daily basis, they most likely are not able to meet with their trainer daily for a variety of reasons. Dynamic Build will address this pain point.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Dynamic Build will allow clients to experience a customized workout between sessions with their favorite trainer.</p>
<p>Dynamic Build will allow trainers to keep their clients moving throughout the week. During client sessions, trainers can check off exercises and dynamically create a program for their clients to use before their next session. These workouts are created on the fly from an existing library of exercises in the system. The power of this type of workout is that each dynamic workout is custom created based on what the trainer observes during the current session. It is personalized in the now.</p>
<p>Clients will be able to log into their account and view their customized workouts in between sessions with their trainer.</p>
<p>The site will be optimized for both mobile and tablet solutions. For the first iteration, iPhones and iPads will be targeted and tested most thoroughly, although the site will work on a variety of devices.</p>
